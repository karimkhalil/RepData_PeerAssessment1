Reproducable Research: Assignment 1
====================================

First, we load the data file, assuming it's already downloaded into the working 
directory

```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

We then preprocess the data frame so that the date column is of date type

```{r}
data$date <- as.Date(data$date,"%Y-%m-%d")
```
